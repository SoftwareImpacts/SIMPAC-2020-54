0                   % solver_type: type of final AMG composition; 0 multiplicative, 1 symmetrized multi., 2 additive; NB: Here put 0 for single AMG component

0.8                 % rho: desired convergence rate of the composite AMG; NB: This is not generally obtained if criterion on max_hrc is reached
